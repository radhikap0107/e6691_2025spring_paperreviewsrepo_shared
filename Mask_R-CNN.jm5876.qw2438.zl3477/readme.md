# Mask R-CNN Training and Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files for training and predicting with Mask R-CNN.

## Files
- **`main_predict_E.ipynb`**: This notebook is used for performing predictions using a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model.
- **`train_multi_GPU.ipynb`**: This notebook is used for training Mask R-CNN using multiple GPUs.

## Prediction Instructions
If you only want to run predictions, please follow these steps:

1. **Download Pre-trained Weights**
   - Before running `main_predict_E.ipynb`, download the necessary weights from the following link:
     [Mask R-CNN Pre-trained Weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pkKcSXHvVtSH8VmLeK8hgB8idwBDMuFR?usp=drive_link)
   - Ensure that the downloaded weights are placed in the correct directory as required by the notebook.

2. **Run `main_predict_E.ipynb`**

## Training Instructions
If you wish to train Mask R-CNN from scratch or fine-tune the model, use `train_multi_GPU.ipynb`.
