# YOLO Models Collection

This repository contains example code to accompany a class presentation on YOLO (You Only Look Once) models for object detection and computer vision tasks.

## Contents

- **YOLOv8 Notebook**: Demonstrates how to use YOLOv8 for object detection tasks. This notebook shows the implementation, training, and inference capabilities of YOLOv8. The notebook is sourced from [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/).

- **YOLOv11 Notebook**: Showcases the latest YOLOv11 model and its improvements over previous versions. The notebook includes examples of model usage and performance evaluations. This notebook is also from [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/).

- **YOLOv9 Repository**: Implementation of the YOLOv9 object detection model. This work was developed by Kin-Yiu Wong, Assistant Professor of Physics Department, Hong Kong Baptist University and was obtained from [WongKinYiu/yolov9](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov9).
